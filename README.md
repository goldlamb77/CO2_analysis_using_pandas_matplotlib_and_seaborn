# 🌍 CO₂ Emissions Analysis Using Python

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the [Our World in Data CO₂ Emissions dataset](https://github.com/owid/co2-data), using Python and libraries like pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.

## 📌 Objective
To analyze CO₂ emissions trends by country over time, uncover insights, and visualize per capita and source-based emissions.

## 🧾 Dataset
- Source: Our World in Data
- Format: CSV
- Link: [owid-co2-data.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/co2-data/master/owid-co2-data.csv)
- Fields: `country`, `year`, `co2`, `co2_per_capita`, `gdp`, `population`, etc.

## 📊 Key Features
- Clean and filter data
- Handle missing values
- Line plots, bar plots, and stacked bar charts
- Insights by country and emission source

## 🧠 Skills Practiced
- Data wrangling with pandas
- Visualization using seaborn/matplotlib
- Real-world dataset handling
- Insight generation from trends

## 🏁 How to Run
